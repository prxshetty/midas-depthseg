# Depth Segmentation with MiDaS

This is a mini project where i just see the capabilities of Intels MiDaS model which is known for predicting depth maps from a single RGB image, which can be used in various applications such as 3D reconstruction, robotics, AR, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The project is written in Python.
- **PyTorch**: Used to load and run the MiDaS model for depth estimation.
- **MiDaS**: A model from Intel's research team that performs monocular depth estimation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the input images and their corresponding depth maps.
- **Torchvision**: For image transformations and handling pre-trained models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have all the necessary files required for this model to work.
